# RFP: Archive Filecoin Chain State Explorer for Wave 5

**Name of Project:** Filecoin Chain State Explorer:Filplorer

## Project Description

An interactive visual tool to dive into the Filecoin state trie would help protocol developers and researchers do in-depth analysis. The 1st level could be an interpretation of the actual tree and include key Actors, a map of the HAMT data structure, etc. Currently a latest trie snapshot is ~10GB.
Also see the RFP for Diagram the Filecoin blockchain

Existing tools:
- The lotus node implementation of Filecoin has a Postgres database tool called chainwatch on top of which a visual chain explorer has been built.
- Several block explorers for Filecoin (_filscan.io, filscout.io, filplorer.com_) have been developed
- Filecoinâ€™s state trie is unique but this  _Ethereum state trie diagram_  provides an example of what may be involved
Preferred applicants should be able to work independently and learn how the Filecoin state trie is structured using the  _Filecoin Specification_  and the various Filecoin node implementations.

## Outcome

- Interactive and high performance chain data tree explorer
- Along with updated **filplorer.com**

## Team

(**Filplorer.com** was built by our team previously, chain state explorer is planned to updated upon **filplorer.com**)
