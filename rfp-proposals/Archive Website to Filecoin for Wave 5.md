# RFP: Archive Website to Filecoin for Wave 5

**Name of Project:** Archive Website to Filecoin

**Proposer:** [@DecentralTech]

## Project Description

A browser extension that allows users to archive websites to IPFS and backup to Filecoin. This extension could also provide a Filecoin wallet so that users can pay for archival and as a way to keep track of what they have saved.
In the future this could be expanded to ways to collaborate on and share archived bookmarks in online communities or as bookmarking services (e.g.  _Pinboard_ , Pinterest, etc.)
A Twitter bot such as the former  _Link Archiver_  could automatically archive websites from tweeted links.
This project would need to explore the required infrastructure for these services.

- Copyright protection and Privacy protection
- Inspire share and search for free
